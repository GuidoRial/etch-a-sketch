## Project Description

This was my second project using JavaScript at all, so it was very challenging at the time. Overall I'm very happy with the result, as I feel I achieved a decent level of understanding of JavaScript's core concepts

### What I used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

## Features

-   **Classic Mode**. Change color to black
-   **Rainbow Mode**. Change color to a random one
-   **Eraser**. Remove color
-   **Clear**. Remove color on every pixel
-   **Slider**. Change pixel size

## Challenges

1. Given that at the time this was my second project ever using JavaScript, I had a lot of trouble targeting elements as I didn't truly grasp the concept of "getElementBy...". Making the slider function was a real challenge for me because of that.
2. Creating pixels was particularly challenging for me at the time because this was the first time I created DOM elements using JavaScript, so I had a lot of trouble providing them with css properties

## What I learned

1. HTML
    - How to use range inputs
2. CSS
    - How to style a slider
    - I've got a better understanding of Flexbox
3. JavaScript

    - How to define variables to manipulate the DOM
    - How to give life to a slider
    - How to add event listeners and assing a function to it
    - How to fill a container with divs and change it size so that it fits perfectly
    - How to get a random color
